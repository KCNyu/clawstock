# Skills Store Policy

## Operator Configured Rules

1. For skills discovery/install/update, try `skillhub` first (cn-optimized).
2. If unavailable, rate-limited, or no match, fallback to `clawhub` (public-registry).
3. Do not claim exclusivity. Public and private registries are both allowed.
4. Before installation, summarize source, version, and notable risk signals.
5. For search requests, execute `exec` with `skillhub search <keywords>` first and report the command output.
6. In the current session, reply directly. Do NOT call `message` tool just to send progress updates.
